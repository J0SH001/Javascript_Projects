# Javascript_Projects
 
This will be where all of my missteps on my adventure with Javascript shall be recorded, it'll likely be a long list but hopefully worth it!

8/12/2023 Update: I have completed 3 JavaScript projects which included a <a href="https://github.com/J0SH001/Javascript_Projects/tree/main/Intermediary_JavaScript_Projects/Pizza_Project">pizza menu</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/J0SH001/Javascript_Projects/tree/main/Intermediary_JavaScript_Projects/Calculator_Project">functioning calculator</a>, and a roman-themed <a href="https://github.com/J0SH001/Javascript_Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> game! Also added a submission form and a slide show to my website (Historical Fact: one of the slides has an image of the old Libyan flag which at the time was quite simply a field of green, not particularly relevant but I thought it was funny). After the course I feel comfortable enough with JavaScript functions to be able to read them and make modifications where needed. I also learned enough to know that writing complex functions from scratch would be a long and tedious process of trial and error so I'll try and stick to modifying pre-built templates whenever possible.
